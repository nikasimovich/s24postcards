       <h5>Visiting James Murphy’s of LCD Soundsystems hip club</h5>
      <p>
      Are you craving a quintessential Williamsburg experience? Come to Nightmoves on a valley night, an unassuming Sunday. If you try to come during peak times, Friday and Saturday nights, you most likely will not get in. Why? This is a well-loved space, a gem owned by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, whose expertise in music, wine, and all things Brooklyn attract like-minded individuals, people that love to dance and chat over a bottle of wine. The volume of the music is just right, and the beats spun on vinyl offer a wash of warmth and life on a frigid January eve. Did I mention this Head Hi event is free? Just shoot them an RSVP on their website, and you’ll easily breeze past the notoriously strict door staff. 
      </p>

      The space is located next to Murphy’s established restaurant and wine bar, The Four Horsemen. It has been transformed from an old speakeasy bar into a 70s/80s artist loft vibe with decor like sculpted hands holding lightbulbs to match. There is a DJ booth, equipped with a Technics SL1200 setup that plays vinyl from Murphy’s personal record collection via a sound system designed by Murphy, powered by McIntosh MC2500 amplifiers. Murphy explains, “Usually, because amplifiers are quite expensive, you wind up with things that are just, almost enough to do the job and they’re strained." But at Daymoves, (the daytime coffee shop version of Nightmoves) “there’s no strain. They’re really open and easy sounding.” The speakers loom above the dance floor, enveloping the dance floor in a sound bath.</p>

        I love going to Nightmoves, but as I said, only on a Sunday. The last time I went was also on a random Sunday night with a group of friends for Head Hi’s five year anniversary party. This time I almost went alone because some people need a bit more convincing than others to go out the night before the work week. However, my friend did end up joining me because both of us have pretty non-traditional schedules. And as he said, “neither of us would be asleep at 10 or even 11 pm anyways.” </p>

      <p>
       I am not really a club, oontz oontz, person. When I say that I mean I hate going out to clubs or bars in Manhattan, and avoid that scene as much as possible. The scene being one where frat boys turned consultants in Patagonia vests frequent. The clubs there tend to play your typical bar mitzah music from middle school, if that’s your vibe. I have a particular set of “Brooklynite” things that I enjoy, and I do not resent the stereotype. I choose to spend my weekends in with a movie, at a dive bar with a pool table, or at techno listening bars. Think Public Records, Frog Bar, or The Lot Radio. I crave a chill atmosphere: not too relaxed that it’s boring, but not so overwhelming in stimulus. Nightmoves is a venue that provides a balance of being able to dance to music that I would listen to at home, within a social setting. What more could a girl ask for? </p>

        <p> If you try to go to Nightmoves, you might miss it. There is no signage and you have to go down an inconspicuous narrow alleyway before even getting to the front door. It used to not be listed on Google Maps, but they’ve shed that bit of pretension in recent months. There is free coat check where they will remind you of the rules of the bar. No phones on the dance floor and no photos either. As such, it is a great place to really engage with your surroundings and connect with the music and fellow house enthusiasts. The space is dim, with warm lighting interspersed throughout, and a back nook complete with arm chairs upholstered in green velvet. The overall effect is an intimate gathering where dancing and reading to coexist. </p>

           <p> Nightmoves as an institution fosters connections with local arts and music communities, such as Head Hi, an organization that brings together people passionate about architecture and design publications. Additionally, there is a rotation of djs that appeals to a range of music interests. I am not a fan of exclusivity and although Nightmoves has its fair share of that, having multiple free/open events with different local partners every month does temper that reputation. The only prior knowledge I had before coming to Nightmoves was from the snazzy graphic posters they post on Instagram to advertise their events, which in my opinion, works to build intrigue. Since you cannot take photos inside, you really have to go see it for yourself! </p>
