     Churches and libraries sit in the same category for me. There are not many places left where people hush upon entering and remain at that level until they leave. I’ve always found them to be both welcoming and daunting in that regard. As a child, I would sit in Sunday Mass and have my vision fixed on the ceiling above me, appearing miles away. Once I spotted a spider. I must have fit right in, looking up to the Lord. When in reality, mine was right there looking back at me.

        The event started with the chime of the bells in the tower above. Walking down the street towards the church, I was being summoned. As I entered, I became highly aware of my breath. I walked down the aisle, skipping pews that were already accounted for. People were scattered, some in couples, others alone. I silently fumbled with hatch on a pew until it let loose and I stepped into my own wooden rectangle. To my left, behind a stretching gothic column, was a man on his phone either sharing the sounds of the church with another or multitasking his meditation.

          Throughout the 45 minutes of echoing sound, newcomers came and went, wrapping up sopping umbrellas in an attempt of courtesy. Certain moments were fluid. My mind was immersed, without floating curiosities of the time or the gaze of others. I was brought back when the musician seemed to go on their own path, unable to follow what was on the page in front of them.

          When the organ took a pause from singing with its whole body, the bodies of people around me became louder. Someone two rows back shifting in their seat would reverberate from one pew to the next all the way to the front of the church.

         <p> Some moments were ethereal, others grand, seeming as though it could bring the walls down with it or crack the glowing stain glass that lined the windows above.

        The name of the event was what caught my eye initially. Meditations are seemingly opened ended. Meditation in a religious space is not. The event is open to the public every weekend for as long as it runs. I came with a curiosity about the kind of people I would find already in the pews once I arrived, or if there would be anyone else at all. As I listened, I thought of all the people who aren’t traditionally welcomed within the walls of this holy gothic architecture. Could people come to practice their religion in an open space during this time? Did people from other religions or people like me, unsure of where I land these days, feel welcomed? Who are the backs of the heads I carefully examined and what brought them here today?

          That’s something interesting about gathering in community. Sometimes being surrounded by others can actually make you feel more aware of the individual than the communal.

          I attended a book talk recently between two trans women who have recently published books on the intersection of human transitions and nature. One of the women originated from the Philippines. When she moved to the U.S., she didn’t understand why there was such an emphasis on being an individual. "Wasn’t that very lonely?"

           As I was listening to the organ’s voice rise and fall, I thought back to her words. I looked around at the people that surrounded me, dotted throughout the pews. Who were they? And how “public” can a public event really be today?

            I think about communal gathering often. Usually, I wonder who doesn’t feel welcome in the space, or who didn’t even dare show up. Where are they today?

          Churches have remained a space I go back to every so often, in the in-between moments. The paintings and columns holding up the structure don’t hold the same meaning for me. But I do go to listen. Whether that be to my own thoughts, the amplified sounds of others, or music that fills the space, I go to meditate, in some form.
