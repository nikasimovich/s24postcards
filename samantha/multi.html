               On the Saturday following Zoe Fleishaker’s 24th birthday, ninety five people squeeze into the four bedroom apartment she shares with her three best friends from college. They are all there to celebrate her. But beneath the surface, there are other celebrations taking place. Firstly, three of the four girls have just received acceptance letters to law school. Zoe to Michigan, Gabby to Columbia, and Natalie to UCLA. Secondly, it is Zoe’s and Avi’s third anniversary. They started dating quietly during the pandemic, and though their closest friends know about their relationship, they have not formally come out to their broader circle of friends and family.

               This party has many layers to it, and in each pocket of conversation one can glean what the others think they are here for. There is a cake, with three candles, on which someone has written “YAY!” in pink frosting. Everyone sings Happy Birthday and present the cake to Zoe, who waits for Gabby and Natalie to blow out to candles. “It is such a gift to have these sisters for life,” Natalie says in a drunken toast about halfway through the night. She is using tonight to silently auction her three latest paintings, an abstract series evoking feelings of togetherness and growth.

            <p>
               This is a story about long-lasting friendship and the power of women supporting each other through thick and thin. In many of the speeches given about Zoe tonight a common theme arose: her ability to find people she loves and hold on to them, bringing them with her for the rest of her life. It is a bittersweet moment acknowledging that these four women, who have spent every day together for the last six years, will have to go in separate directions.

               Zoe and Avi's relationship, though private, is not secret, and it has enriched both of their lives immensely--as well as the lives of their friends. Their bond is a classic modern love story that has withstood homophobia, family disapproval, quarantine, and long distance. Though not everyone knows they are together, everyone knows they are deeply supportive of each other. The beginning of this new chapter for Zoe brings with it some difficult conversations and potential obstacles for the pair, but they are confident they will be able to make it work, regardless of the geography involved.
