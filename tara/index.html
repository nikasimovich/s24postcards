As a child, Ockenfels experimented with portraiture by photographing his peers. He launched his career after he captured Tracy Chapman for Rolling Stone.

        <h5>Celebrity Factor and Escaping Perfectionism</h5>
        <p>
        Although artists such as David LaChapelle and Cindy Sherman have centered celebrities in their photography, Ockenfels's works offer a refreshing storytelling aspect incorporating personalized touches. By combining the skills of photography and journaling, Ockenfels welcomes the consumer into the complexities of his mind. Further, we can see the process of his creations in the present time. As a "baby photographer, "I must admit that although the celebrity factor captivated me, it was his practice of highlighting certain body parts and angling the camera in ways that displayed both control on his end and freedom of the subject that were distinct. Ockenfels's use of uncouth canvases, such as skateboards, scraped medals, and newspapers, reflects his openness to modernity and individuality. His disapproval of perfection is evident within his works and speech. The ability to transform an untouchable, flawless figure such as "the celebrity" and produce a product containing purposeful blemishes that do not distract from the subject is seldom seen.
