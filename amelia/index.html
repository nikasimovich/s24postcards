      Entering Bouldering Project’s newest location is a bit strange, for many reasons. First, I get a hit of deja vu when I realize on the walk to the rock climbing gym that I’ve been here before, visiting another climbing gym that’s only two blocks away called the Cliffs at Gowanus. Or, at least it was called the Cliffs when I went; Bouldering Project Brooklyn shares a two block radius and a change of ownership with the other gym. The Cliffs at Gowanus was purchased and added to Movement Climbing’s 29 locations across the US, alongside its four sister locations in NYC and Philadelphia; Bouldering Project Brooklyn was formerly the flagship location of Brooklyn Boulders, a franchise with locations now in Queens and Chicago but, weirdly, not Brooklyn. The other thing that’s weird is that Bouldering Project Brooklyn looks exactly like the gym I learned to climb at--Austin Bouldering Project.

        <h5>Design Choices</h5>
        <p>
        Both gyms have an industrial-cool vibe with high ceilings and exposed pipes, bright multicolored accents behind the check-in desk, and dusty teal climbing walls with brightly colored plastic holds in strange shapes that resemble earlobes, clusters of bubbles, bony spines, geometric models, and occasionally rocks. They both have locker rooms stocked with freebies like band-aids, sanitary pads, lotion, hair ties, and dry shampoo. They both have yoga classes, showers, and cold plunge tubs that are out of service currently but will be in operation soon, they promise. I can’t think of anything worse than dunking myself in ice water after climbing and then taking the subway home, but to each their own.

      Despite the uncanny feeling that this gym may as well be in Austin, or Salt Lake City, or Boston, or any of Bouldering Project’s 11 total locations, there are benefits to keeping my regular climbing membership in the BP family. I’m always complaining about the gyms in New York City and comparing them to my beloved Austin Bouldering Project: The wall texture is so much better! The holds are so much newer and grippier! The routes aren’t boring or too hard! They have yoga classes, showers, and cold plunge tubs! It’s five minutes from my house! All those things (except transit times) have been delivered to me halfway across the country.

        <h5>Community Interaction</h5>
        <p>
        The people are just as friendly and encouraging as they are in Austin. I spend a few minutes attempting a route with two people who don’t seem to speak English; we communicate in exhausted sighs and gestures that mean “that’s impossible”, “that hold is too small to grab”, “nice job”, “I give up”. I’m motivated to finish another route that scares me a little after I see a girl no older than 10 scamper up to the top, and we give each other thumbs ups after I collapse to the ground, exhausted but accomplished.

      These kind of interactions are the type that climbing gyms use to market themselves as “community spaces”. It’s true that climbers are generally friendly, encouraging, and non-judgmental, but there’s always exceptions. Climbing is a sport that’s had to go through reckonings in the last few years over the face that women and people of color can be made to feel unwelcome, from individual interpersonal interactions to gym management to USA Climbing, the governing body of competitive climbing in the country. It’s also an expensive sport beloved by tech bros and the kind of people who move in as rents go up in historic neighborhoods (myself included).

      As I look around Bouldering Project Brooklyn and see welcoming signage about “the community”,  I wonder what exactly is being done to embrace and create community. Something about the lack of specificity in the Bouldering Project design is giving me a weird feeling; why Brooklyn, then? Does BP actually care about the community of their neighborhood, the people who live and work in the area or were pushed out as it gentrified?

      I’m conflicted as I leave the gym to head back to Manhattan with my hands burning pleasantly, my muscles sore, and my hair freshened with the free dry shampoo. Despite the strangeness of the experience, I can’t deny that I liked it better than the other gyms I’ve attended in NYC. I’ve been looking forward to the gym’s renovation into the BP style, and I’ve been enticed into a membership by their reopening deals. But I can’t help but feel that the rosy shades have come off, causing me to take a clearer look at a fitness industry that I both love and want to do better.
