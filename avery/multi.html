      On a warm winter weekend at the New Museum, the Image to Dance workshop began with instructor and artist-in-residence, Camilo Godoy, offering the quote “hard times require furious dancing.” This quote from the artist and writer, Alice Walker set the tone for a workshop focused on interpreting the provided historical images into body movements. After a brief introduction from Alethea Rockwell, the Keith Haring Director of Education and Public Engagement at the New Museum, Camilo Godoy welcomed the class of 25 participants, encouraging them to use the space as they needed and to listen to their bodies throughout the time together in the studio. Godoy became a resident at the New Museum in the Fall of 2023, and has crafted a series of workshops and performances through February. On this Saturday, February 3rd, Godoy hosted Image to Dance, an hour and half of participants engaging with black and white images, creating poses from those images, and ultimately creating a choreographed dance with a partners, combining the poses they extracted from the images.

        The studio became alive with the moving of bodies alongside newly made friends, becoming co-conspirators in a dance of their own making.
