      Despite overcast skies and low temperatures, spirits ran high and warm in Chinatown on Saturday, January 27th 2024. Over the course of a few hours members of The W.O.W. Project visited several Chinatown businesses, performing lucky dragon dances. The women, queer, trans and youth-led group uses arts activism to advocate self-determination for NYC’s Chinatown amid gentrification and an expanding prison industrial complex.

      <p style="text-align: center;">
      Founded in 2016, the W.O.W. Project was started in response to changes in Chinatown spurred by gentrification. By organizing events, residencies, youth programs, and public artwork the group fosters intergenerational solidarity among community members facing displacement.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><p style="text-align: center;">
      This event was one among a series hosted by the group as part of their annual From Chinatown, With Love program in celebration of the lunar new year, including art builds, an exhibition at Abron’s Art Center, and a calendar made in collaboration with local artists. True to their intersectionalist artistic mission, that night they collaborated with The Illuminator (a political projection collective), projecting messages of protest on the scheduled demolition and rebuild/expansion of a local MegaJail, formerly known as the Tombs.

      For W.O.W. members, supporting their geographical community means supporting people first and foremost. Luck is not only the realized wish of safe, inclusive communities, but also the product of calling each other in with care. When one member held a red orb in my direction saying “Touch this for luck” I gladly accepted.
