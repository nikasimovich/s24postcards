    <p>Nested between two electronics shops on West 27th Street, the Center for Book Arts is unlike most other spaces within the neighborhood. I stepped into the building’s elevator with cursory knowledge of the organization, figuring it would be something between a library and a museum.</p>
    <p>When the doors opened to the third floor, I was greeted by an intermingling of noise. The sounds of an audience attentively responding to a lecture combined with that of lively chatter and whirring machinery.</p>
    <p>Such plurality, both in experience and thought, has been a defining trait of the Center (also known as CBA) since its opening in 1974. Its founder, businessman and bookbinder Richard Minsky, set out to develop a not-for-profit space that gave artists the facilities to pursue <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2023/03/artonic/Center-for-Book-Arts">“all aspects of the book arts”</a>: ranging from paper-making and production to publishing and conservation.</p>
    <p>50 years later, CBA finds itself continuing this mission through expanded educational resources, exhibitions and the pursuit of community building.</p>

    <p>During my visit, the Center was celebrating this notable anniversary with a members exhibition entitled <a href="https://centerforbookarts.org/50th-anniversary-members-exhibition-exhibition">“Hello Thank You Come In”</a>, named after an archival poster from CBA’s original Bleecker Street storefront. The displayed books explored the material and conceptual extents of the book as both medium and content. </p>
    <p>Autonomy, a piece by artist <a href="https://julieshawlutts.wordpress.com/portfolio/autonomy/">artist Julie Shaw Lutts</a>, takes the form of vintage women’s gloves covered in handwritten ink defining the words “autonomy”, “justice” and “liberty” across the 3 different pairs. Conversely, <a href="https://mistakehouse.org/buzz-spector-artwork/">Buzz Spector</a> uses a conventional found book in his piece Short Shorts, with all pages torn at incremental lengths to create a frayed and deconstructed spread.</p>
    <p>Alongside this showcase, the CBA’s main atrium was exhibiting <a href="https://centerforbookarts.org/exposition-litteraire-autour-mallarme-exhibition">the works of poet Stéphane Mallarmé</a> and the legacy of his poem, "Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard". Walls were covered with diverse interpretations of Mallarmé’s seminal work, appropriating its typographic structure and themes of redaction and illegibility.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most prominent display of illegibility was a chalk drawing of the poem, written out on the floor of the gallery space. After 11 days of visitors, its words had been reduced to trampled markings and a few unerased fragments around the corners of the room.</p>

    <p>After perusing a participatory wall of books that all contain the words “un coup de dés” (<span class="italic">a throw of the dice</span>), I decided to check out CBA’s print shop and its ongoing mechanical sounds. The room was crowded with materials and machinery. Shelves full of type cases lined the walls, full with metal casts of typefaces I have ashamedly, as a design student myself, only ever encountered in digital settings. The vibrant cacophony was the result of what seemed like a small printmaking class.</p>
    <p>Visitors of the Center like myself could walk through this classroom, observing this craft through the work of others. I learned from one of the students, who was drying their half-finished piece, that they were all participating in a letterpress workshop conducted by renown printer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Paul_Kennedy_Jr.">Amos Paul Kennedy Jr</a>.</p>
    <p>At the moment, they had finished a layer of silver typography, composed in Kennedy’s signature style, and would continue their prints the next day. “He’s come here all the way from Detroit, can you believe it?”, they said, “It’s practically the other end of the world!”</p>

    <p>Figures like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz5ecqlOJCC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D">Kennedy Jr.</a> are a part of the diverse network of creators and activists that directly shape CBA’s place and politics. In the past week, the Center has generated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3InN4iNEY5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">public criticism</a> after withdrawing its invitation to exhibit artist Sister Sylvester’s piece, <span class="italic">The Eagle and The Tortoise</span>, expressing concerns over it seeming “too closely aligned with the current conflict in Gaza”. In a joint message, <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/871819/center-for-book-arts-backs-out-of-kathryn-hamilton-marin-day-performance-drawing-criticism/">Sister Sylvester and other collaborating artists told Hyperallergic</a>, “This is part of a larger pattern of intimidation and censorship of those who speak up for Palestine”.</p>
    <p>CBA’s decision has been met with a petition from associated creators asking to reinstate the exhibition, as well as a critical statement from its unionized staff. Such recent events are a pressing reminder that the espoused plurality of this organization is only possible from the continuous efforts of its community. “Institutions are more than the people who lead them,” underlined the team behind <span class="italic">The Eagle and The Tortoise</span>.</p>
